<!--

Welcome! - We kindly ask that you:

  1. Fill out the issue template below - not doing so needs a good reason.
  2. Use the forum if you have a question rather than a bug or feature request.

The forum is at: https://forum.restic.net

The forum is a better place for questions about restic or general suggestions
and topics, e.g. usage or documentation questions! This issue tracker is mainly
for tracking bugs and feature requests directly relating to the development of
the software itself, rather than the project.

Thanks for understanding, and for contributing to the project!

What are you trying to do?
--------------------------

This section should contain a brief description what you're trying to do, which

Answering this question is not required, but if you have anything positive to share, please do so here!
Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a little positive end note does wonders.
