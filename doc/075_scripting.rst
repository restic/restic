  Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is
  determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s
  Style Guide for documenting which you may follow:

  # with overline, for parts
  * for chapters
  = for sections
  - for subsections
  ^ for subsubsections
  " for paragraphs

Scripting
#########################

This is a list of how certain tasks may be accomplished when you use
restic via scripts.

Check if a repository is already initialized
********************************************

You may find a need to check if a repository is already initialized,
perhaps to prevent your script from initializing a repository multiple
times. The command ``cat config`` may be used for this purpose:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo cat config
    Fatal: unable to open config file: stat /srv/restic-repo/config: no such file or directory
    Is there a repository at the following location?
    /srv/restic-repo

If a repository does not exist, restic will return a non-zero exit code
and print an error message. Note that restic will also return a non-zero
exit code if a different error is encountered (e.g.: incorrect password
to ``cat config``) and it may print a different error message. If there
are no errors, restic will return a zero exit code and print the repository
metadata.
