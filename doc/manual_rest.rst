    Use "restic [command] --help" for more information about a command.

Similar to programs such as ``git``, restic has a number of
sub-commands. You can see these commands in the listing above. Each
sub-command may have own command-line options, and there is a help
option for each command which lists them, e.g. for the ``backup``
command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./restic backup --help

    The "backup" command creates a new snapshot and saves the files and directories
    given as the arguments.

    EXIT STATUS
    ===========

    Exit status is 0 if the command was successful.
    Exit status is 1 if there was a fatal error (no snapshot created).
    Exit status is 3 if some source data could not be read (incomplete snapshot created).

Subcommands that support showing progress information such as ``backup``,
``restore``, ``check`` and ``prune`` will do so unless the quiet flag ``-q``
or ``--quiet`` is set. When running from a non-interactive console progress
reporting is disabled by default to not fill your logs. For interactive and
non-interactive consoles the environment variable ``RESTIC_PROGRESS_FPS`` can
be used to control the frequency of progress reporting. Use for example
``0.016666`` to only update the progress once per minute.

Additionally, on Unix systems if ``restic`` receives a SIGUSR1 signal the
current progress will be written to the standard output so you can check up
on the status at will.

Setting the `RESTIC_PROGRESS_FPS` environment variable or sending a `SIGUSR1`
signal prints a status report even when `--quiet` was specified.

Manage tags
-----------

Managing tags on snapshots is done with the ``tag`` command. The
existing set of tags can be replaced completely, tags can be added or
removed. The result is directly visible in the ``snapshots`` command.

Let's say we want to tag snapshot ``590c8fc8`` with the tags ``NL`` and
``CH`` and remove all other tags that may be present, the following
command does that:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo tag --set NL --set CH 590c8fc8
    create exclusive lock for repository
    modified tags on 1 snapshots

Note the snapshot ID has changed, so between each change we need to look up the
new ID of the snapshot. But there is an even better way - the ``tag`` command
accepts a filter using the ``--tag`` option, so we can filter snapshots based
on the tag we just added. This way we can add and remove tags incrementally:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo tag --tag NL --remove CH
    create exclusive lock for repository
    modified tags on 1 snapshots

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo tag --tag NL --add UK
    create exclusive lock for repository
    modified tags on 1 snapshots

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo tag --tag NL --remove NL
    create exclusive lock for repository
    modified tags on 1 snapshots

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo tag --tag NL --add SOMETHING
    no snapshots were modified

To operate on untagged snapshots only, specify the empty string ``''`` as the
filter value to ``--tag``. The following command will add the tag ``OTHER``
to all untagged snapshots:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo tag --tag '' --add OTHER

Under the hood
--------------

Browse repository objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internally, a repository stores data of several different types
described in the `design
documentation <https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/design.rst>`__.
You can ``list`` objects such as blobs, packs, index, snapshots, keys or
locks with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo list snapshots
    d369ccc7d126594950bf74f0a348d5d98d9e99f3215082eb69bf02dc9b3e464c

The ``find`` command searches for a given
`pattern <https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match>`__ in the
repository.

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r backup find test.txt
    debug log file restic.log
    debug enabled
    enter password for repository:
    found 1 matching entries in snapshot 196bc5760c909a7681647949e80e5448e276521489558525680acf1bd428af36
      -rw-r--r--   501    20      5 2015-08-26 14:09:57 +0200 CEST path/to/test.txt

The ``cat`` command allows you to display the JSON representation of the
objects or their raw content.

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo cat snapshot d369ccc7d126594950bf74f0a348d5d98d9e99f3215082eb69bf02dc9b3e464c
    enter password for repository:
    {
      "time": "2015-08-12T12:52:44.091448856+02:00",
      "tree": "05cec17e8d3349f402576d02576a2971fc0d9f9776ce2f441c7010849c4ff5af",
      "paths": [
        "/home/user/work"
      ],
      "hostname": "kasimir",
      "username": "username",
      "uid": 501,
      "gid": 20
    }

Metadata handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restic saves and restores most default attributes, including extended attributes like ACLs.
Information about holes in a sparse file is not stored explicitly, that is during a backup
the zero bytes in a hole are deduplicated and compressed like any other data backed up.
Instead, the restore command optionally creates holes in files by detecting and replacing
long runs of zeros, in filesystems that support sparse files.

The following metadata is handled by restic:

- Name
- Type
- Mode
- ModTime
- AccessTime
- ChangeTime
- UID
- GID
- User
- Group
- Inode
- Size
- Links
- LinkTarget
- Device
- Content
- Subtree
- ExtendedAttributes


Getting information about repository data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``stats`` command to count up stats about the data in the repository.
There are different counting modes available using the ``--mode`` flag,
depending on what you want to calculate. The default is the restore size, or
the size required to restore the files:

-  ``restore-size`` (default) counts the size of the restored files.
-  ``files-by-contents`` counts the total size of unique files as given by their
   contents. This can be useful since a file is considered unique only if it has
   unique contents. Keep in mind that a small change to a large file (even when the
   file name/path hasn't changed) will cause them to look like different files, thus
   essentially causing the whole size of the file to be counted twice.
-  ``raw-data`` counts the size of the blobs in the repository, regardless of how many
   files reference them. This tells you how much restic has reduced all your original
   data down to (either for a single snapshot or across all your backups), and compared
   to the size given by the restore-size mode, can tell you how much deduplication is
   helping you.
-  ``blobs-per-file`` is kind of a mix between files-by-contents and raw-data modes;
   it is useful for knowing how much value your backup is providing you in terms of unique
   data stored by file. Like files-by-contents, it is resilient to file renames/moves.
   Unlike files-by-contents, it does not balloon to high values when large files have
   small edits, as long as the file path stayed the same. Unlike raw-data, this mode
   DOES consider how many files point to each blob such that the more files a blob is
   referenced by, the more it counts toward the size.

For example, to calculate how much space would be
required to restore the latest snapshot (from any host that made it):

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic stats latest
    password is correct
    Total File Count:   10538
          Total Size:   37.824 GiB

If multiple hosts are backing up to the repository, the latest snapshot may not
be the one you want. You can specify the latest snapshot from only a specific
host by using the ``--host`` flag:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic stats --host myserver latest
    password is correct
    Total File Count:   21766
          Total Size:   481.783 GiB

There we see that it would take 482 GiB of disk space to restore the latest
snapshot from "myserver".

In case you have multiple backups running from the same host so can also use
``--tag`` and ``--path`` to be more specific about which snapshots you
are looking for.

But how much space does that snapshot take on disk? In other words, how much
has restic's deduplication helped? We can check:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic stats --host myserver --mode raw-data latest
    password is correct
    Total Blob Count:   340847
          Total Size:   458.663 GiB

Comparing this size to the previous command, we see that restic has saved
about 23 GiB of space with deduplication.

Which mode you use depends on your exact use case. Some modes are more useful
across all snapshots, while others make more sense on just a single snapshot,
depending on what you're trying to calculate.


Scripting
---------

Restic supports the output of some commands in JSON format, the JSON
data can then be processed by other programs (e.g.
`jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`__). The following example
lists all snapshots as JSON and uses ``jq`` to pretty-print the result:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo snapshots --json | jq .
    [
      {
        "time": "2017-03-11T09:57:43.26630619+01:00",
        "tree": "bf25241679533df554fc0fd0ae6dbb9dcf1859a13f2bc9dd4543c354eff6c464",
        "paths": [
          "/home/work/doc"
        ],
        "hostname": "kasimir",
        "username": "fd0",
        "uid": 1000,
        "gid": 100,
        "id": "bbeed6d28159aa384d1ccc6fa0b540644b1b9599b162d2972acda86b1b80f89e"
      },
      {
        "time": "2017-03-11T09:58:57.541446938+01:00",
        "tree": "7f8c95d3420baaac28dc51609796ae0e0ecfb4862b609a9f38ffaf7ae2d758da",
        "paths": [
          "/home/user/shared"
        ],
        "hostname": "kasimir",
        "username": "fd0",
        "uid": 1000,
        "gid": 100,
        "id": "b157d91c16f0ba56801ece3a708dfc53791fe2a97e827090d6ed9a69a6ebdca0"
      }
    ]

.. _temporary_files:

Temporary files
---------------

During some operations (e.g. ``backup`` and ``prune``) restic uses
temporary files to store data. These files will, by default, be saved to
the system's temporary directory, on Linux this is usually located in
``/tmp/``. The environment variable ``TMPDIR`` can be used to specify a
different directory, e.g. to use the directory ``/var/tmp/restic-tmp``
instead of the default, set the environment variable like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ export TMPDIR=/var/tmp/restic-tmp
    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo backup ~/work


.. _caching:

Caching
-------

Restic keeps a cache with some files from the repository on the local machine.
This allows faster operations, since meta data does not need to be loaded from
a remote repository. The cache is automatically created, usually in an
OS-specific cache folder:

* Linux/other: ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/restic``, or ``~/.cache/restic`` if
  ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` is not set
* macOS: ``~/Library/Caches/restic``
* Windows: ``%LOCALAPPDATA%/restic``

If the relevant environment variables are not set, restic exits with an error
message.

The command line parameter ``--cache-dir`` or the environment variable
``$RESTIC_CACHE_DIR`` can be used to override the default cache location.  The
parameter ``--no-cache`` disables the cache entirely. In this case, all data
is loaded from the repository.

If a cache location is explicitly specified, then the ``check`` command will use
that location to store its temporary cache. See :ref:`checking-integrity` for
more details.

The cache is ephemeral: When a file cannot be read from the cache, it is loaded
from the repository.

Within the cache directory, there's a sub directory for each repository the
cache was used with. Restic updates the timestamps of a repository directory each
time it is used, so by looking at the timestamps of the sub directories of the
cache directory it can decide which sub directories are old and probably not
needed any more. You can either remove these directories manually, or run a
restic command with the ``--cleanup-cache`` flag.
