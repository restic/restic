..
  Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is
  determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Python’s
  Style Guide for documenting which you may follow:

  # with overline, for parts
  * for chapters
  = for sections
  - for subsections
  ^ for subsubsections
  " for paragraphs

Encryption

*"The design might not be perfect, but it’s good. Encryption is a first-class feature,
the implementation looks sane and I guess the deduplication trade-off is worth
it. So… I’m going to use restic for my personal backups.*" `Filippo Valsorda`_

Manage repository keys
**********************

The ``key`` command allows you to set multiple access keys or passwords
per repository. In fact, you can use the ``list``, ``add``, ``remove``, and
``passwd`` (changes a password) sub-commands to manage these keys very precisely:

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo key list
    enter password for repository:
     ID          User        Host        Created
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    *eb78040b    username    kasimir   2015-08-12 13:29:57

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo key add
    enter password for repository:
    enter password for new key:
    enter password again:
    saved new key as <Key of username@kasimir, created on 2015-08-12 13:35:05.316831933 +0200 CEST>

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo key list
    enter password for repository:
     ID          User        Host        Created
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     5c657874    username    kasimir   2015-08-12 13:35:05
    *eb78040b    username    kasimir   2015-08-12 13:29:57

Note that the currently used key is indicated by an asterisk (``*``).
