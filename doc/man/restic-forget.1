.SH NAME
.PP
restic-forget - Remove snapshots from the repository


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrestic forget [flags] [snapshot ID] [...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "forget" command removes snapshots according to a policy. All snapshots are
first divided into groups according to "--group-by", and after that the policy
specified by the "--keep-*" options is applied to each group individually.

.PP
Please note that this command really only deletes the snapshot object in the
repository, which is a reference to data stored there. In order to remove the
unreferenced data after "forget" was run successfully, see the "prune" command.

.PP
Please also read the documentation for "forget" to learn about some important
security considerations.


.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
Exit status is 0 if the command was successful, and non-zero if there was any error.
