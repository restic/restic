.SH NAME
.PP
restic-copy - Copy snapshots from one repository to another


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrestic copy [flags] [snapshotID ...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "copy" command copies one or more snapshots from one repository to another.

.PP
NOTE: This process will have to both download (read) and upload (write) the
entire snapshot(s) due to the different encryption keys used in the source and
destination repositories. This /may incur higher bandwidth usage and costs/ than
expected during normal backup runs.

.PP
NOTE: The copying process does not re-chunk files, which may break deduplication
between the files copied and files already stored in the destination repository.
This means that copied files, which existed in both the source and destination
repository, /may occupy up to twice their space/ in the destination repository.
This can be mitigated by the "--copy-chunker-params" option when initializing a
new destination repository using the "init" command.
