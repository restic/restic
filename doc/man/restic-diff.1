.SH NAME
.PP
restic-diff - Show differences between two snapshots


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrestic diff [flags] snapshotID snapshotID\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "diff" command shows differences from the first to the second snapshot. The
first characters in each line display what has happened to a particular file or
directory:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
+  The item was added
.IP \(bu 2
-  The item was removed
.IP \(bu 2
U  The metadata (access mode, timestamps, ...) for the item was updated
.IP \(bu 2
M  The file's content was modified
.IP \(bu 2
T  The type was changed, e.g. a file was made a symlink
.IP \(bu 2
?  Bitrot detected: The file's content has changed but all metadata is the same

.RE

.PP
Metadata comparison will likely not work if a backup was created using the
\&'--ignore-inode' or '--ignore-ctime' option.

.PP
To only compare files in specific subfolders, you can use the
"snapshotID:subfolder" syntax, where "subfolder" is a path within the
snapshot.


.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
Exit status is 0 if the command was successful.
Exit status is 1 if there was any error.
Exit status is 10 if the repository does not exist.
Exit status is 11 if the repository is already locked.
