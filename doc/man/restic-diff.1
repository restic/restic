restic-diff - Show differences between two snapshots


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrestic diff [flags] snapshotID snapshotID\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "diff" command shows differences from the first to the second snapshot. The
first characters in each line display what has happened to a particular file or
directory:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
+  The item was added
.IP \(bu 2
-  The item was removed
.IP \(bu 2
U  The metadata (access mode, timestamps, ...) for the item was updated
.IP \(bu 2
M  The file's content was modified
.IP \(bu 2
T  The type was changed, e.g. a file was made a symlink

.RE

.PP
To only compare files in specific subfolders, you can use the
":" syntax, where "subfolder" is a path within the
snapshot.


.SH EXIT STATUS

Exit status is 0 if the command was successful, and non-zero if there was any error.
