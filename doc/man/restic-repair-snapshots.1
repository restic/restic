.SH NAME
.PP
restic-repair-snapshots - Repair snapshots


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrestic repair snapshots [flags] [snapshot ID] [...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "repair snapshots" command repairs broken snapshots. It scans the given
snapshots and generates new ones with damaged directories and file contents
removed. If the broken snapshots are deleted, a prune run will be able to
clean up the repository.

.PP
The command depends on a correct index, thus make sure to run "repair index"
first!


.SH WARNING
.PP
Repairing and deleting broken snapshots causes data loss! It will remove broken
directories and modify broken files in the modified snapshots.

.PP
If the contents of directories and files are still available, the better option
is to run "backup" which in that case is able to heal existing snapshots. Only
use the "repair snapshots" command if you need to recover an old and broken
snapshot!

.PP
Exit status is 0 if the command was successful, and non-zero if there was any error.
