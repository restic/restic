.SH NAME
.PP
restic-stats - Scan the repository and show basic statistics


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrestic stats [flags] [snapshot ID] [...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "stats" command walks one or multiple snapshots in a repository
and accumulates statistics about the data stored therein. It reports
on the number of unique files and their sizes, according to one of
the counting modes as given by the --mode flag.

.PP
It operates on all snapshots matching the selection criteria or all
snapshots if nothing is specified. The special snapshot ID "latest"
is also supported. Some modes make more sense over
just a single snapshot, while others are useful across all snapshots,
depending on what you are trying to calculate.

.PP
The modes are:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
restore-size: (default) Counts the size of the restored files.
.IP \(bu 2
files-by-contents: Counts total size of files, where a file is
considered unique if it has unique contents.
.IP \(bu 2
raw-data: Counts the size of blobs in the repository, regardless of
how many files reference them.
.IP \(bu 2
blobs-per-file: A combination of files-by-contents and raw-data.

.RE

.PP
Refer to the online manual for more details about each mode.

Exit status is 0 if the command was successful, and non-zero if there was any error.
