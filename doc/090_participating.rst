Debug Logs
**********

Set the environment variable ``DEBUG_LOG`` to let restic write extensive debug
messages to the specified filed, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    $ DEBUG_LOG=/tmp/restic-debug.log restic backup ~/work

If you suspect that there is a bug, you can have a look at the debug
log. Please be aware that the debug log might contain sensitive
information such as file and directory names.

The debug log will always contain all log messages restic generates. You
can also instruct restic to print some or all debug messages to stderr.
These can also be limited to e.g. a list of source files or a list of
patterns for function names. The patterns are globbing patterns (see the
documentation for `filepath.Match <https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match>`__).
Multiple patterns are separated by commas. Patterns are case sensitive.

Printing all log messages to the console can be achieved by setting the
file filter to ``*``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ DEBUG_FILES=* restic check

If you want restic to just print all debug log messages from the files
``main.go`` and ``lock.go``, set the environment variable
``DEBUG_FILES`` like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ DEBUG_FILES=main.go,lock.go restic check

The following command line instructs restic to only print debug
statements originating in functions that match the pattern ``*unlock*``
(case sensitive):

.. code-block:: console

    $ DEBUG_FUNCS=*unlock* restic check


*********
Debugging
*********

The program can be built with debug support like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ go run build.go -tags debug

This will make the ``restic debug <subcommand>`` available which can be used to
inspect internal data structures.

In addition, this enables profiling flags such as ``--cpu-profile`` and
``--mem-profile`` which can help with investigation performance and memory usage
issues. See ``restic help`` for more details and a few additional
``--...-profile`` flags.

Running Restic with profiling enabled generates a ``.pprof`` file such as
``cpu.pprof``. To view a profile in a web browser, first make sure that the
``dot`` command from `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`__ is in the PATH. Then,
run ``go tool pprof -http : cpu.pprof``.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please **open an issue first** (or add a
comment to an existing issue) if you plan to work on any code or add a
new feature. This way, duplicate work is prevented and we can discuss
your ideas and design first.

More information and a description of the development environment can be
found in `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.
A document describing the design of restic and the data structures stored on the
back end is contained in `Design <https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design.html>`__.

If you'd like to start contributing to restic, but don't know exactly
what do to, have a look at this great article by Dave Cheney:

Writing tests
*************

In case you want to create tests for an enhancement or a new feature of a restic command,
here is a brief description of how to write tests. There are currently more than
600 tests defined for testing restic; in addition there are more than 80 helper functions
in existence to make testing life easier for you.

Tests are typically falling into two categories: functional tests and integration tests.
Functional tests will verify correct workings of a function / set of functions.
Integration tests however test overall workings of a command:
::

 run a ``backup``, compare number of files backup with the expected number of files
 run a ``backup``, run the ``ls`` command with a ``sort`` option
 compare actual output with the expected output.

For all backup related functions there is a directory tree which will be backed up
by default, to be found at ``cmd/restic/testdata/backup-data.tar.gz``.
In this compressed directory tree in which you will find files, hardlinked files,
symlinked files, an empty directory and a simple directory structure which is ok for testing purposes.

Have a look at the ``cmd/restic/*_integration_test.go`` files. In there you will find a
wealth of helper functions which make life easier for you when you are testing.

These are the standard functions to check for a specific type of result
::

 rtest.Equals(t, a, b, "msg")       compares two values, fail test if differ
 rtest.Assert(t, a == b, "msg")     checks for a condition to be true
 rtest.OK(t, err)                   expects err to be ``nil``, otherwise fail test
 rtest.OKs(t, errs)                 expects a slice of errs to be ``nil``
 testListSnapshots(t, env.gopts, n) expects exactly <n> snapshots in the repository

If you need to capture output from a command, look out for examples with ``withCaptureStdout`` in
``cmd/restic/*_test.go``. Basicly, stdout gets attached to a ``bytes.Buffer``.
In addition, you can use the global option ``gopts.JSON: true`` to generate JSON output
which then can be unmarshalled to produce approriate go structures; see
``cmd/restic/cmd_find_integration_test.go`` as an example.

This is a typical setup for a backup / find scenario is
::

 env, cleanup := withTestEnvironment(t)
 defer cleanup()

 testSetupBackupData(t, env)
 opts := BackupOptions{}
 testRunBackup(t, env.testdata+"/0", []string{"."}, opts, env.gopts)
 testListSnapshots(t, env.gopts, 1)

 results = testRunFind(t, false, FindOptions{}, env.gopts, "testfile")
 lines := strings.Split(string(results), "\n")
 rtest.Assert(t, len(lines) == 2, "expected one file, found (%v) in repo", len(lines)-1)

commented
::

 env, cleanup := withTestEnvironment(t)        // setup test
 testSetupBackupData(t, env)                   // init repository
 testRunBackup(t, env.testdata+"/0", ...)      // run a backup
 testListSnapshots(t, env.gopts, 1)            // make sure you have one snapshot
 testRunFind(t, false, FindOptions{}, ...)     // run restic find, look for file 'testfile'
 lines := strings.Split(string(results), "\n") // there is always a ``\n`` at  the end of the output!
 rtest.Assert(t, len(lines) == 2, ...)         // make sure that you have correct output

When it comes to writing tests in the ``internal`` directory tree, things can become
a bit more tricky, since you haven't necessarily got the full support of an opened repository
with the full works.

*************
Compatibility
*************

Backward compatibility for backups is important so that our users are
always able to restore saved data. Therefore restic follows `Semantic
Versioning <https://semver.org>`__ to clearly define which versions are
compatible. The repository and data structures contained therein are
considered the "Public API" in the sense of Semantic Versioning.

Once version 1.0.0 is released, we guarantee backward compatibility of
all repositories within one major version; as long as we do not
increment the major version, data can be read and restored. We strive
to be fully backward compatible to all prior versions.

During initial development (versions prior to 1.0.0), maintainers and
developers will do their utmost to keep backwards compatibility and
stability, although there might be breaking changes without increasing
the major version.

**********************
Building documentation
**********************

The restic documentation is built with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__,
therefore building it locally requires a recent Python version and requirements listed in ``doc/requirements.txt``.
This example will guide you through the process using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__:

::

  $ virtualenv venv # create virtual python environment
  $ source venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
  $ cd doc
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies
  $ make html # build html documentation
  $ # open _build/html/index.html with your favorite browser
