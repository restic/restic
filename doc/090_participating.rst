  Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is
  determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s
  Style Guide for documenting which you may follow:

  # with overline, for parts
  * for chapters
  = for sections
  - for subsections
  ^ for subsubsections

Debug Logs
**********

Set the environment variable ``DEBUG_LOG`` to let restic write extensive debug
messages to the specified filed, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    $ DEBUG_LOG=/tmp/restic-debug.log restic backup ~/work

If you suspect that there is a bug, you can have a look at the debug
log. Please be aware that the debug log might contain sensitive
information such as file and directory names.

The debug log will always contain all log messages restic generates. You
can also instruct restic to print some or all debug messages to stderr.
These can also be limited to e.g. a list of source files or a list of
patterns for function names. The patterns are globbing patterns (see the
documentation for `filepath.Match <https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match>`__).
Multiple patterns are separated by commas. Patterns are case sensitive.

Printing all log messages to the console can be achieved by setting the
file filter to ``*``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ DEBUG_FILES=* restic check

If you want restic to just print all debug log messages from the files
``main.go`` and ``lock.go``, set the environment variable
``DEBUG_FILES`` like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ DEBUG_FILES=main.go,lock.go restic check

The following command line instructs restic to only print debug
statements originating in functions that match the pattern ``*unlock*``
(case sensitive):

.. code-block:: console

    $ DEBUG_FUNCS=*unlock* restic check


*********
Debugging
*********

The program can be built with debug support like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ go run build.go -tags debug

This will make the ``restic debug <subcommand>`` available which can be used to
inspect internal data structures. In addition, this enables profiling support
which can help with investigation performance and memory usage issues.

Contributions are welcome! Please **open an issue first** (or add a
comment to an existing issue) if you plan to work on any code or add a
new feature. This way, duplicate work is prevented and we can discuss
your ideas and design first.

More information and a description of the development environment can be
found in `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.
A document describing the design of restic and the data structures stored on the
back end is contained in `Design <https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design.html>`__.

*************
Compatibility
*************

Backward compatibility for backups is important so that our users are
always able to restore saved data. Therefore restic follows `Semantic
Versioning <https://semver.org>`__ to clearly define which versions are
compatible. The repository and data structures contained therein are
considered the "Public API" in the sense of Semantic Versioning. This
goes for all released versions of restic, this may not be the case for
the master branch.

We guarantee backward compatibility of all repositories within one major
version; as long as we do not increment the major version, data can be
read and restored. We strive to be fully backward compatible to all
prior versions.

**********************
Building documentation
**********************

The restic documentation is built with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__,
therefore building it locally requires a recent Python version and requirements listed in ``doc/requirements.txt``.
This example will guide you through the process using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__:

::

  $ virtualenv venv # create virtual python environment
  $ source venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
  $ cd doc
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies
  $ make html # build html documentation
  $ # open _build/html/index.html with your favorite browser
