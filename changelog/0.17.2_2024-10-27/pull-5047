Bugfix: Resolve potential error during concurrent cache cleanup

When multiple restic processes ran concurrently, they could compete to remove
obsolete snapshots from the local backend cache, sometimes leading to a "no
such file or directory" error. Restic now suppresses this error to prevent
issues during cache cleanup.
