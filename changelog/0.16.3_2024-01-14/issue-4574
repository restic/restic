Bugfix: Support backup of deduplicated files on Windows again

With the official release builds of restic 0.16.1 and 0.16.2, it was not
possible to back up files that were deduplicated by the corresponding
Windows Server feature. This also applied to restic versions built using
Go 1.21.0-1.21.4.

The Go version used to build restic has now been updated to fix this.
