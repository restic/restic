Enhancement: Add support for --exclude-cloud-files on macOS (e.g. iCloud drive)

Restic treated files stored in iCloud drive as though they were regular files.
This caused restic to download all files (including files marked as cloud only) while iterating over them.

Restic now allows the user to exclude these files when backing up with the `--exclude-cloud-files` option.

Works from Sonoma (macOS 14.0) onwards. Older macOS versions materialize files when `stat` is called on the file.
