Enhancement: Support include filters in `rewrite` command

The enhancement enables the standard include filter options
      --iinclude pattern     same as --include pattern but ignores the casing of filenames
      --iinclude-file file   same as --include-file but ignores casing of filenames in patterns
  -i, --include pattern      include a pattern (can be specified multiple times)
      --include-file file    read include patterns from a file (can be specified multiple times)

The exclusion or inclusion of filter parameters is exclusive, as in other commands.
