Enhancement: Back up and restore Windows Alternate Data Streams

Restic did not back up Alternate Data Streams in Windows. Restic now backs up Alternate Data Streams (ADS) and restores them back to the main files.
The Alternate Data Streams are backed up like any other normal files, and the full name of the stream is stored as the name of the file.
During restore, the ADS are restored and attached to the original files as Alternate Data Streams.
For progress and summary, the ADS are not counted in the file counts, but the sizes of the ADS files are counted.
