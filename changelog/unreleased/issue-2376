Enhancement: Add per snapshot description

Restic can now store user supplied descriptions for snapshots.
When creating a new snapshot the description can be supplied
using `restic backup --description <description>`.

`restic snapshots` can be used to show description of snapshots.

`restic description <snapshot id> <description>` is used
to change the description of existing snapshots.
To remove a description supply an empty `""` description.
