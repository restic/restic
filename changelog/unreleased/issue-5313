Enhancement: Add `sftp.server-alive-interval` and `sftp.server-alive-count-max` options

Restic previously did not set the `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax`
SSH options when connecting to an SFTP server, resulting in backups being
interrupted on some connections. It now sets these options to the values
specified by the `sftp.server-alive-interval` and `sftp.server-alive-count-max`
configuration options, to avoid connections being interrupted unnecessarily.
The default values are 25 seconds for `ServerAliveInterval` and
200 for `ServerAliveCountMax`. If either is set to -1,
the corresponding SSH option is not set and the value from the SSH
configuration is used.
