Enhancement: Back up windows created time and file attributes like hidden flag

Restic did not back up windows-specific meta-data like created time and file attributes like hidden flag.
Restic now backs up file created time and file attributes like hidden, readonly and encrypted flag when backing up files and folders on Windows.
