Enhancement: Allow stripping directories when restoring

Restic restore always restored the full backed up path to a target location.
For example restoring `/home/work/foo` to `/home/restores` would create `/home/restores/home/work/foo`.
Restic now, much like `tar` permits trimming the structure on restore allowing to skip first N levels of directories using the `--strip-components` option.
This way you can now restore  `/home/work/foo` to `/home/restores/foo` using `--strip-components=2`.
Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped.
