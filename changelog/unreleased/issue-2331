Enhancement: Add case-insensitive support to commands with snapshot filters

The `copy`, `find`, `ls`, `restore`, `snapshots`, and `forget` commands now support
case-insensitive filtering when using `--host`, `--tag`, and `--path` filters via the
`SnapshotFilter` struct. This addresses the long-standing issue where machine names and
tags with inconsistent casing made it difficult to filter snapshots. Users in environments
with mixed-case hostnames (e.g. Windows) can now easily find and manage snapshots
without needing to look up the exact casing.
