Enhancement: Add case-insensitive support to commands with snapshot filters

All `restic` commands, which use a `data.SnapshotFilter` now support
case-insensitive filtering when using `--host`, `--tag`, and `--path` filters.
This addresses the long-standing issue where machine names and
tags with inconsistent casing made it difficult to filter snapshots. Users in environments
with mixed-case hostnames (e.g. Windows) can now easily find and manage snapshots
without needing to look up the exact casing.
