Bugfix: Fix S3 DEEP_ARCHIVE restore failing with "202 Accepted"

When restoring from S3 Glacier or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes using the
experimental `s3-restore` feature, restic incorrectly treated the HTTP 202
Accepted response as an error. This caused the restore to fail immediately
with the message "202 Accepted" instead of waiting for the objects to become
available.

Restic now correctly recognizes HTTP 202 Accepted as a successful restore
initiation and waits for the objects to transition from cold storage before
proceeding with the restore.
