Bugfix: Ignore "chmod not supported" errors when writing files

Restic 0.18.0 introduced a bug that caused "chmod xxx: operation not supported"
errors to appear when writing to a local file repository that did not support
chmod (like CIFS or WebDAV mounted via FUSE). Restic now ignores those errors.
