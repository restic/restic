Enhancement: Add snapshot filtering options `--newer-than` and `--older-than`

You can now use time based filters in all command which use a restic.SnaspshotFilter.

There are different means of specifying a time based filter option.
* `--newer-than` and `--older-than` can be used to specify a date or a date time
* `--newer-than` and `--older-than` can be used to specify a snap ID, meaning the
time of when the snapshot was taken.
* `--newer-than` and `--older-than` can be a relative time distance,
  a `restic.Duration` in the form '<y>y<m>m<d>d<h>h', used extensively in
  `restic forget` policies.

In order to relate to a restic.Duration, you need to specify a time reference,
using the option `--relative-to`. When no explicit time reference is given,
`--relative-to latest` is used for defining the time reference.

All of these options can have one of the following values:
* the string `now`, reference to the current time.
* a timestring, according to `time.DateTime`: 'yyyy-m-d H:M:S', or just the date
  part 'yyyy-m-d', implying midnight as the time part. There is no need of specifying
  a leading '0' in any of 'm', 'd', 'H', 'M' or 'S'.
* a `restic.Duration` in the form '<y>y<m>m<d>d<h>h', the order of 'y', 'm', 'd' and
  'h' does not matter.
* a valid snapshot ID, including the string `latest`.

The testing for time boundaries is implemented in such a way that the boundary value is
included in the test, despite the names `--newer-than` and `--older-than`.
Therefore `--newer-than <snapID>` will include `snapID` in its result list if the
rest of the filter options will permit it.

You can filter a snapshot range by both specifying `--older-time` and `--newer-time`:

use `restic -r ... snapshots --older-time '2024-6-1' --newer-time '2024-06-30 23:59:59'`
to list all snapshots in the month of June 2024.
