Enhancement: Add snapshot filtering options `--newer-than` and `--older-than`

In addition you can now specify different means of a time reference
using the `--relative-to` option. The definition of these options is as follows:
`--newer-than` <= snapshot-time and snapshot-time <= `--older-than`

All of these options can have one of the following values. Not all of the these
values make sense in all instances, but they are implemented this way.
The values are:
- `now`, a time reference to the current time
- a timestring, according to `time.DateTime`: 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS'
- a `restic.Duration` in the form '<y>y<m>m<d>d<h>h', used extensively in
  `forget` policies
- a reference to a snapshot ID, including `latest`.

You can now filter a snapshot range by both specifying `--older-time` and `--newer-time`:
`restic -r ... snapshots --older-time '2024-06-01 00:00:00' --newer-time '2024-06-30 23:59:59'`
to list all snapshots in the month of June 2024.

Since this is implemented in `restic.SnapshotFilter`, it will be usuable in all
commands which use it.
