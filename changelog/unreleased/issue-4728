Enhancement: Added support for zstd compression levels `fastest` and `better`

Restic now supports the zstd compression modes `fastest` and `better`. Set the
environment variable `RESTIC_COMPRESSION` to `fastest` or `better` to use these
compression levels. This can also be set with the `--compression` flag.
