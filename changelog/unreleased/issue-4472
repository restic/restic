Enhancement: Allow AWS Assume Role to be used for S3 backend

Previously only credentials discovered via the Minio discovery methods
were used to authenticate.

However, there are many circumstances where the discovered credentials have
lower permissions and need to assume a specific role. This is now possible
using the following new environment variables.

- RESTIC_AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN
- RESTIC_AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME
- RESTIC_AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_EXTERNAL_ID
- RESTIC_AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_REGION (defaults to us-east-1)
- RESTIC_AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_POLICY
- RESTIC_AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_STS_ENDPOINT
