Enhancement: `restic diff` is now able to compare two different hosts

In the past you could only compare two different snapshots and get an overview
over differences.

You can now compare snapshots from two different hosts, which can be further filtered
by subfolder. The output shows common data blobs together with their size, and
the data blobs used only by host A and host B.
