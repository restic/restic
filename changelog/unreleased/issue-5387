Enhancement: Show data transfer speed in backup progress

The backup progress display previously showed only the amount of data processed
but did not indicate the current transfer speed, making it difficult to assess
performance in real-time or optimize backup operations.

Restic now displays the data transfer speed (in MB/s) during backup operations.
Both the current speed (calculated over the last 15 seconds) and the overall
average speed are shown in the progress output, allowing users to monitor
backup performance and identify bottlenecks.
