Enhancement: Enable backup privilege when first beginning a backup on Windows

Restic `backup` attempted to enable the backup privilege when reading
security descriptors - potentially after being denied access on initial items.
It also read file extended attributes without using the privilege,
possibly missing them and producing errors.

Restic now attempts to enable the privilege when first beginning a backup.
It also requests extended attribute reads use the backup privilege.
