Change: Update dependencies and require Go 1.23 or newer

We have updated all dependencies. Restic now requires Go 1.23 or newer to build.

This also disables support for TLS versions older than TLS 1.2. On Windows,
restic now requires at least Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016. On macOS,
restic now requires at least macOS 11 Big Sur.
