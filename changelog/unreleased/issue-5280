Bugfix: `restic find` now checks for correct ordering of time related options

`restic find` now checks for the correct ordering of the `node.ModTime` related options
`--oldest` and `--newest`.
If both options are present and the ordering of these options is incorrect,
and error message will be issued and the command will be terminated.
