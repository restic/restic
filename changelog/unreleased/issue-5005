Bugfix: Fix rare failures to retry locking a repository

Restic 0.17.0 could in rare cases fail to retry locking a repository if
one of the lock files failed to load. The lock operation failed with error
`unable to create lock in backend: circuit breaker open for file <lock/1234567890>`

The error handling has been fixed to correctly retry locking the repository.
In addition, restic now waits a few seconds between locking retries to
increase chances of success.
