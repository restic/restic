Enhancement: snapshots: Add --sort-by-time option to sort snapshots by time.

Restic now supports sorting snapshots by timestamp with the new `--sort-by-time` option. When used with the `snapshots` command, it lets you list snapshots in ascending (asc) or descending (desc) time order, with ascending order as the default.
