Enhancement: Reduce progress bar refresh rates to reduce energy usage

Progress bars were updated with 60fps which can cause high CPU or GPU usage
for some terminal emulators. Reduce it to 10fps to conserve energy.
In addition, this lower frequency seem to be necessary to allow selecting
anything in the terminal with certain terminal emulators.
