Enhancement: Support restoring ownership by name on UNIX systems

Restic restore used to restore file ownership on UNIX systems by UID and GID.
It now allows restoring the file ownership by user name and group name with `--ownership-by-name`.
This allows restoring snapshots on a system where the UID/GID are not the same as they were on the system where the snapshot was created.
However it does not include support for POSIX ACLs, which are still restored by their numeric value.
