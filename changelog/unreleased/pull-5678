Enhancement: add new type `tree-full` to `restic cat`

`restic cat tree-full <snapshot-id[:subfolder]> generates JSON output for all
participating tree blobs for the selected snapshot or a subfolder thereof. This
will help when troubleshooting problems and relating directory names to JSON
nodes in the repository,
