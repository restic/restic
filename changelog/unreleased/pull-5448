Enhancement: Allow nice and ionice configuration for restic containers

ghcr.io/restic/restic containers now support the following environment variables:

NICE: set the desired nice scheduling.  See `man nice`.
IONICE_CLASS: set the desired I/O scheduling class.  See `man ionice`.  Note that real time support requires the invoker to manually add the `SYS_ADMIN` capability.
IONICE_PRIORITY: set the prioritization for ionice in the given `IONICE_CLASS`.  This does nothing without `IONICE_CLASS`, but defaults to `4` (no priority, no penalties).

See https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/020_installation.html#docker-container for further details.
