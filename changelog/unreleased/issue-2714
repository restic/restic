Enhancement: Allow to set paths saved in snapshots manually

Restic backup always used to save the paths specified for the backup
in the snapshot. We've added new options to set this directly. This
allows to have clearer snapshots and use parent snapshots e.g. if
the files to backup comes from a external file find tool.
