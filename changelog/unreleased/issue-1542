Enhancement: Add --dry-run/-n option to backup command

We added a new --dry-run/-n option to the backup command, which performs
all the normal steps of a backup without actually writing any changes to
the repository. Passing -vv will log information about files that would
be added, allowing verification of source and exclusion backup options
without committing changes to the repository.
