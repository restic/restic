Bugfix: fixed loose permissions of the sftp backend.

Restic now restricts the file permissions on sftp backend to readonly.
In restic 0.18.0 using backup would allow group write permissions on files.
This change affects sftp servers that support the chmod operation, otherwise keeps it the same as before.
