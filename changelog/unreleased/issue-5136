Enhancement: Add snapshot filtering options --older-than and --newer-than

Restic subcommands which work on a set of snapshots (``copy``,
``find``, ``forget``, ``snapshots``, ``tag`` and more) can now filter
on the absolute age of the snapshots specified as a duration, e.g.,
``--newer-than 1d12h`` to only operate on snapshots created less than
36 hours ago, or ``--older-than 90d`` to operate on snapshots older
than three months.
