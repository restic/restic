Bugfix: fix metadata errors during backup of removable disks on Windows

Since restic 0.17.0, backups of removable disks on Windows could report
errors with retrieving metadata like shown below.

```
error: incomplete metadata for d:\filename: get named security info failed with: Access is denied.
```

This has now been fixed.
