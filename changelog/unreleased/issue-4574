Bugfix: support backup of deduplicated files on Windows again

With the official release builds of restic 0.16.1 and 0.16.2, it was not
possible to back up files that were deduplicated by the corresponding Windows
Server feature. This also applies to restic versions built using Go
1.21.0 - 1.21.4.

We have updated the used Go version to fix this.
