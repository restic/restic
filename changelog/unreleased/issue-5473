Enhancement: Add rechunk-copy feature

Restic didn't rechunk data blobs when copying snapshots between repositories
with different chunker parameters. Instead, it copied the blobs as-is,
which impaired deduplication powered by [Content Defined Chunking](https://restic.net/blog/2015-09-12/restic-foundation1-cdc/). 
To mitigate this issue, users had to manually restore the snapshots somewhere,
and then backup them again to the new repository. This workaround was 
inefficient, prone to tamper with the original metadata, and bothersome.

It now supports `rechunk-copy` command, in which the data are rechunked while copying.
Currently, it does not automatically skip previously copied snapshots. Also,
it does not remember which files had been rechunked in previous runs, so it will
try to rework on every file again in the next run (though it would not add new
data blobs to the repository in that case; this is what deduplication is for).
Therefore, `rechunk-copy` is adequate for one-time migration between repositories.
For incremental copy scenarios, `copy` between repositories with same chunker 
parameters is recommended.

`rechunk-copy` shares the same command interface with `copy`, with an exception
that `rechunk-copy` additionally supports a `--rechunk-tag` option to add a
tag to all rechunk-copied snapshots in the destination repository.
