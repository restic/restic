Enhancement: Make --skip-if-unchanged ignore changes in parent directories

Restic’s `backup` command previously created a new snapshot even when the
contents of the selected backup targets were unchanged. This happened because
`--skip-if-unchanged` also considered metadata changes in ancestor directories
outside the specified backup path. As a result, unrelated filesystem activity
(such as modifying files in parent directories) still triggered new snapshots.

Restic now compares only the tree nodes corresponding to the actual backup
targets when `--skip-if-unchanged` is used. Snapshot creation is skipped as 
long as the backed-up directory tree itself remains unchanged.
