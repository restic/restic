Bugfix: Correct multiple errors in `restic find` command

The `restic find` now checks for incompatible options `--newest` and `--oldest`
(modification time testing).
When the given date/times do not obey the ordering `--oldest` < `--newest`,
an error will be raised.

When modification time testing is defined together with ID matching,
an error will be raised.

When more than one ID matching options (`--treeID`, `--blobID`, `--packID`) is
activated, an error will be raised.

`restic find --JSON --show-pack-id` now creates valid JSON output, whereas before
the output was a mixture of JSON and plain text.

Enhancement:
The JSON output of the ID matching commands now contain the additional fields
`packid`, `length`, `offset`, `uncompressedLength`. These fields are always generated,
irrespective of the setting of `--show-pack-id`.

There are 8 more tests for the `restic find` command.
