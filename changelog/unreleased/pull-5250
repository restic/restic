Enhancement: Support native/parallel backup of block devices

Backing up large block devices used to take a long time because Restic
had no native support for it and required passing the content of the device
to stdin, which meant that reading was performed linearly. It now supports
the --read-special flag, which reads the content of block devices and
follows symlinks pointing to them, and the --block-size option, which
divides each file into blocks of the specified size in gigabytes,
allowing them to be read in parallel.
