Enhancement: Add incremental backups

Restic allowed to backup files from a list passed as parameter and this created
a new snapshot, containing only the new backuped files. Now, using the --merge
option, the new snapshot will contain also the files (not included in the list file passed)
of a previous parent snapshot.
