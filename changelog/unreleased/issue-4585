Enhancement: Limit repository size to a given maximum size during backup

`restic backup` and `restic copy` can now limit the repository size to a given
maximum value. The repository size limit can be specified with the option
`--max-repo-size`, with the usual meaning for size related options.

During backup and copy, when `--max-repo-size` is enabled, the current size is monitored
by calculating its actual repository size plus the size of any new blob added
during the backup/copy process.
Once the defined limit is reached, `restic backup/copy` will wind down all
pending operations and create a new partial snapshot.
The result of the backup/copy run is flagged as in error.

The size limit is a rough limit and can only be gtaken as a guide, since packfiles,
indexes and snapshots have to be finalized.
Due to the highly parallel processing of a backup/copy process the limit
can be overshot by several megabytes.
