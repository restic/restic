Enhancement: Limit repository size to a predefined maximum size during vackup

Restic backup can now limit the repository size to a given maximum value. The
repository size limit can be specified as option `--max-repo-size`, with
the usual meaning for size related options.

During backup, the current size is monitored by calculating its actual repository
size plus the size of any new blob added during the backup process. Once the
defined limit is exceeded, backup is prevented from creating new backup entries
and the 'in progress' files are finalized, without adding large amounts of new data.

The size limit is a rough limit and cannot be taken as a precise limit,
since indexes and snapshot file have to be finalized.
Due to the highly parallel processing of a backup process
the limit can be overshot by `packfile size` multiple times.
With a current default of 16m for a packfile,
you might experience differences of multiple megabytes between the expected limit
and the actual size when the backup process terminates.

The new packfiles are created by the current backup process and a new snapshot
will be created.

Currently the implemenation is incomplete. There are currently two indications
that there is a incomplete backup:
field `PartialSnapshot` exist and is set to true and
the snapshot is tagged as `partial-snapshot`.
