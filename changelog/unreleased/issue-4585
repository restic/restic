Enhancement: Limit repository size to a given maximum size during backup

Restic backup can now limit the repository size to a given maximum value. The
repository size limit can be specified with the option `--max-repo-size`, with
the usual meaning for size related options.

During backup, when `--max-repo-size` is enabled, the current size is monitored
by calculating its actual repository size plus the size of any new blob added during the backup process.
Once the defined limit is reached, `restic backup` will wind down all pending opeations and
create a new partial snapshot. The result of the backup run is flagged as in error.

The size limit is a rough limit and can only be gtaken as a guide, since packfiles,
indexes and snapshots have to be finalized.
Due to the highly parallel processing of a backup process the limit can be overshot by
several megabytes (maximum about 32MiB * number-of-cpu-threads).
