Enhancement: Limit repository size to a given maximum size during backup

`restic backup` and `restic copy` can now limit the repository size to a given
maximum value. The repository size limit can be specified with the option
`--max-repo-size`, with the usual meaning for size related options.

During backup and copy, when `--max-repo-size` is enabled, the current size is monitored
by calculating its actual repository size plus the size of any new blob added
during the backup/copy process.

Once the defined limit is reached, `restic backup` will wind down all
pending operations and create a new partial snapshot.
`restic copy` however cannot create a partial snapshot, since `copy` is not creating
a new tree structure but copying the existing one into another repository. This
operation can only succeed of fail as a whole.
The result of the backup/copy run is flagged as in error.

The size limit can only act as a rough guide, since packfiles, indexes and
snapshots have to be finalized. Due to the highly parallel processing of a
backup/copy process the limit can be overshot by several megabytes.
