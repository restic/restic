Enhancement: create snapshot summary statistics for snapshots which don't have them

When restic rewrite is used with the --snapshot-summary [-s] option,
a new snapshot is created containing statistics summary data. Only two fields
will be non-zero: TotalFilesProcessed and TotalBytesProcessed.

There is a logic change in cmd_rewrite: statistics data will always be attached,
even if the old snapshot(s) did not contain summary data.
