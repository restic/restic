Enhancement: create snapshot summary statistics for old snapshots

When `restic rewrite` is used with the `--snapshot-summary` option,
a new snapshot is created containing statistics summary data. The new data tree
is identical to the original data tree.

When `restic rewrite` is called with one of the `--exclude` variants,
a new snapshot summary will be created.

When `restic rewrite` is used with `--new-host` or `--new-time` only, NO snapshot
summary will be produced. The new data tree is identical to the original data tree.

If new snapshot produces a new snapshot summary, only two fields will be non-zero:
`TotalFilesProcessed` and `TotalBytesProcessed`.
