Enhancement: Configurable retry timeout

Restic's retry operations used a hardcoded timeout of 15 minutes,
forcing users to wait the full duration when backends were down or misconfigured.

Restic now allows setting the retry timeout via the --retry-max-elapsed-time flag.
This permits commands like `restic cat config` to fail quickly when backends are unreachable.
