Enhancement: Expand `restic cat` documentation with detailed examples

The documentation for the `restic cat` command was minimal and lacked
details about the various object types it supports. The documentation has been
expanded with comprehensive explanations and practical examples for each subcommand:

- Added detailed documentation for all 8 object types: masterkey, config, snapshot,
  tree, blob, index, key, lock, and pack
- Included code examples showing JSON and binary output formats
- Clarified when output is JSON versus binary
- Added references to related commands (e.g., `restic ls` for human-readable tree output)
- Explained use cases for debugging and understanding repository structure
