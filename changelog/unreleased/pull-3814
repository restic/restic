Enhancement: Make restic find --newest inclusive

restic find would use the first instant of a date or time passed to `--newest`
as the maximum timestamp for files to list. Now it treats the modification time
as a prefix instead, finding for example all files modified in 2022 for
`--oldest 2022 --newest 2022` instead of only those modified in the first
nanosecond of 2022 (previously `--oldest 2022 --newest 2023` had to be used).
