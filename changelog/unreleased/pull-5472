Enhancement: `restic copy` can now spool packfiles across muliple snapshots

When using `restic copy` used to save all newly created packfiles when finishing one snapshot,
even when the actual packfile size was quite small. This applied particularly to
incremental backups, when there was only small changes between individual backups.

When using the new option `--batch`, `restic copy` now creates one large request list
which contains all blobs from all snapshots to be copied and then executes the
copy operation.
