Enhancement: `restic check` for specified snapshot(s) via snapshot filtering

Snapshots can now be specified for the command `restic check` on the command line
via the standard snapshot filter, (`--tag`, `--host`, `--path` or specifying
snapshot IDs directly) and will be used for checking the packfiles used by these snapshots.
