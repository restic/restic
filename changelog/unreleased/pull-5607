Bugfix: Work around FUSE readdir bug on Linux

Restic used to use the Go standard library Readdirnames() function, which ignored files with a zero inode. With certain versions of FUSE, this caused `restic check` to fail on some FUSE filesystems, being unable to find some pack files. This applied particularly to usage of Restic by Deja Dup.

Now, we use our own readdirnames() implementation that doesn't ignore any files, and `restic check` should succeed even with buggy versions of FUSE.
