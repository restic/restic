Change: Replace host and username in key metadata with encrypted label

The key format has been changed to improve privacy. The unencrypted username
and hostname fields have been removed. Instead an encrypted label is available,
which can be set using the `--label` flag when adding a key.

Additionally, the creation timestamp is now stored in UTC to avoid leaking the
timezone information.
