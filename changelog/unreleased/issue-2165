Bugfix: Ignore disappeared backup source files

If during a backup files were removed between restic listing the directory
content and backing up the file in question, the following error could occur:

```
error: lstat /some/file/name: no such file or directory
```

The backup command now ignores this particular error and silently skips the
removed file.
