Bugfix: write pprof file for `--{cpu,mem,...}-profile` even on error code

Before this, if `restic backup --cpu-profile dir/ backup-dir/` couldn't read
some of the input files (e.g. they weren't readable by the user restic was
running under), the `cpu.pprof` file it outputs would be empty.

This applies to all of `--cpu-profile`, `--mem-profile`, `--trace-profile`, and
`--block-profile`. These options require compiling restic with debug support,
see <https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/090_participating.html#debugging>.
