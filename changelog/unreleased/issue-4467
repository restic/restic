Bugfix: Exit with code 3 when some targets do not exist

Restic used to exit with code 0 even when some targets did not exist. Restic 
would exit with code 3 only when child directories or files did not exist. This
could cause confusion and unexpected behavior in scripts that relied on the exit
code to determine if the backup was successful.

Restic now exits with code 3 when some targets do not exist.
