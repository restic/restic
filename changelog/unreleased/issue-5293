Enhancement: prune small packfiles more aggressively

prune reads all packfiles and their sizes, sorts them by ascending size order.
It picks the first percentile value from the sorted list of packfile sizes and
applies the scale factor of 80% to it and uses it for its prune decisions.

As a consequence, the option `--repack-small` is not longer needed and has been
marked as deprecated.
