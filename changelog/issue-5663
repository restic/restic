Enhancement: allow content comparison in `restic diff` command

Restic diff now allows the user to visualize the differences of two snapsshots
of the same text file.

Binary files will not be compared and text file comparison will be limited to
a size of 1 MiB by default. If you want to compare larger text files, use the option
`--diff-max-size` to modify the size limit.
The comparator uses the library algorithm implemented in "github.com/hexops/gotextdiff/myers".
