# The first line must start with Bugfix:, Enhancement: or Change:,

Enhancement: Allow custom bar in the `foo` command

# Describe the problem in the past tense, the new behavior in the present
# tense. Mention the affected commands, backends, operating systems, etc.
# If the problem description just says that a feature was missing, then
# only explain the new behavior. Aim for a short and concise description.
# Use "Restic now ..." instead of "We have changed ...".
#
# Focus on user-facing behavior, not the implementation. The description should
# be understandable for a regular user without knowledge of the implementation.

Restic foo always used the system-wide bar when deciding how to frob an
item in the `baz` backend. It now permits selecting the bar with `--bar`
or the environment variable `RESTIC_BAR`. The system-wide bar is still
the default.
