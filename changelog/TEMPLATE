Enhancement: Allow custom bar in the foo command

# Describe the problem in the past tense, the new behavior in the present
# tense. Mention the affected commands, backends, operating systems, etc.
# Focus on user-facing behavior, not the implementation.
# Use "Restic now ..." instead of "We have changed ...".

Restic foo always used the system-wide bar when deciding how to frob an
item in the `baz` backend. It now permits selecting the bar with `--bar`
or the environment variable `RESTIC_BAR`. The system-wide bar is still
the default.
