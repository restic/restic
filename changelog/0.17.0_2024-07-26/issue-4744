Change: Include full key ID in JSON output of `key list`

The JSON output of the `key list` command has changed to include the full key
ID instead of just a shortened version of the ID, as the latter can be ambiguous
in some rare cases. To derive the short ID, please truncate the full ID down to
eight characters.
